My name is Muhammad Tariq, I am Research Assistant/Ph.D. student in Physics, working with Dr. Stinaff's group at Nano-Scale Quantum Phenomena Institute (NQPI), Ohio University, Athens. I have done a masterâ€™s in Physics with research focused on Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy from Riphah International University, Islamabad, Pakistan. Presently, I am doing research on the synthesis and characterization of Transition Metal Dichalcogenides (TMDs) in general and MoS2 growth/ characterization in particular.

Thanks for reading!
